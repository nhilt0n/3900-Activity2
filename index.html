<p>Hi I am Nick Hilton, a junior at University of Omaha. I am studying Management Information Systems and IT Innovation. Programming is like math for me, in thats I find it astract and tedious. When not in class I am working, at the Apple Store as a technical specialist. I am intrigued by the emerging asset class of cryptocurrencies. </p>
